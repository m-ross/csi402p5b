The arguments this program requires are one flag from among "-c", "-x", and "-p". If "-c" is specified, the next argument must be the filename of an unformatted archive file to be created; following that, up to 255 filenames may be supplied which refer to files that will be added to the archive. If "-x" is specified, the only other argument must be the filename of an existing unformatted archive file to be read from; the program will extract each file contained in the archive file. If "-p" is specified, the next argument must be a string to search for in the filenames, and the next argument after that must be the filename of an existing unformatted archive file to be read from; the program will print to stdout the name and size of each file whose name starts with the specified string.
